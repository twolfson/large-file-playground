# large-file-playground
Playground repo to explore git extensions for large files

Over the years, I've had visual assets stored in repositories or some derivative asset stored (e.g. perceptual hash). Unfortunately, there have been drawbacks (e.g. repo bloat, loss of original file). This repo is to explore the different options for storing large files in `git`
